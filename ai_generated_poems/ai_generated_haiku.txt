the rain
drops on,
falling leaves,
falling off leaves

the dark
in my tea
with the dead bird

the moon 
faintly blue
behind the plate

tighter colors
in the window
the same moon

night of stars
the first
a line of ants

long nights
on the ground
a sheet napkin

the scent
of cold pressed sugar
sipped from old love letters

the end of a sentence
my hands on my hips
as my mouth moves

warm night
as the train passes
between the mountains

my lover
talks of whisky -
only he talks of
my lover

in the toilet bowl
the bird chatter
not audible

in the autumn mist
the sound of a child
becomes a fly

a damp January night
the sound of piss
in the empty stall

the sound of a child
becomes a fly
two passengers on the tarmac
on foot

the full moon
before leaving
full moon

the train arrives
on time
the full moon

the sound
of a child
becomes a fly

a damp January night
the sound of piss... enters the room

my way
with a stick
all night long

empty stand
the sound
of people flirting
with death

invisible
the sound of rain
on the clothesline

winter evening
a spider with off
till it attacks

the sound
of people flirting -
full moon

empty stall
the sound of a child
becomes a fly

full moon
full moon

the sound
of people flirting -
full moon

the train arrives
on time
with full view

in the empty compartment
the bird
tick tick tick
tick tick tick tick

the full moon
before leaving
full moon

first light
the sound
of people flirting -
full moon

my age
talks of age
before leaving

the lake
more or less blank -
all we see
is asphalt

still the water -
not the source
of a spider's hunger

my age
talks of age -
all the wrongs
of the road

too busy
to notice
the sound
of someone talking

night
in the empty compartment
the spider
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick

after the storm
one hour left
open tin cans

in the crescent moon
the full moon
at dawn

in a bar
the full moon
at midnight

still drinking
from a cologne bottle
first day of the year

the river brings
a new friend
to the table

a new lease on the land
on the street
than grass and flowers
begin to sessile

just finished
a rose petal
in a drunk's hair

morning meditation...
she looks back
at her nails

in the twilight mist
she watches her reflection
with wild abandon

a new book
on a coffee break
from the side of the road

rain has forced
out the sparrow's shadow
the stone buddha

her parents' house -
the only light in
the empty Christmas tree

twilight
just one path
for lilies

the stone buddha
on her forehead
and out the window

a rush-hour
at least one car
with vacuum
the lost dog

the cold
inside the taxi
my passengers

three months
too slow a time
for that wave

a taxi full of s***
autumn rains
on the lake

dandelion seeds
my passengers leave
the wrong house

my journey
snow clouds drift
in the wind from the temple

cold rain
on the stone wall
the scent of the flowers

two days
of blue irises
in the autumn rain

cold thunder
a cicada mare waddles away
bit by bit

cold sleet
the cactus wings
ripe for plum blossom

cold wind
wet clothes
the weathered cow

cold coffee
I'm not telling
I want to be alone

cold milk 
the toadstom
of spring light

cold milk 
she brings home
her kitty

cold coffee
she leaves me
her pajama bottoms

cold milk 
she puts on her headphones
and writes
her email

cold milk 
she gives me an apple
between the thumb and index

cold milk
a white nap came earlier
than a sunny one

cold white snow
she wears sunglasses
to the

Walking the last two miles of the busy intersection
and listening to rustling
in the wind.

morning sun -
the new year
in the mailbox

night of fireworks
a few dozen

midnight
the moon
over the barbed wire 

morning sun
the old couple
in our shared kitchen

morning sun
my wife's grave
in the cemetery

morning sun
she's still nursing the cancer
a new friend

my neighbor's garden
still full

how I want to sleep tonight

the late night

I wish I was
a woman

the way my neighbor looks
after the cancer

morning sun
just a tiny bit
of the old man

morning sun
a big smile on his face
this morning's news

morning sun
a crow's call
in my window

morning sun
I missed your ex-girlfriend
in the window

morning sun
a new friend
in the same room

morning sun
I wish I could buy
a new sweater

morning sun
I wish I could jazz the accordion
in the car

morning sun
I wish I could smoke
a cigar

morning sun
I wish I could listen
to your songs

morning sun
I wish I could
speak to you faster

I wish I could
stand next to the
old man

I wish I could
speak to you
without the lights

he would
stop talking

the cancer

the spirits of the rain -
first fallen leaves

the edge of the garden -
a guffawing
between two stones

rain on the river -
the dampness
of a damp envelope

moonlight on the roof -
the silence
of the streetlight

when the wind picks up -
my shadow
died in the Grand Canal

wind chime -
the coldness
of a candle

year's end -
another dead
enclosed in the bottom

full moon
on the fireman's helmet -
the last whistle of a distant train

night of stars -
the warmth
of the candle

the empty bed -
no stars
deserted beach

subway light -
another hollow
in the light pole

Across the bay -
the silent flight
of seagulls

subway noise -
a hopscotch
in the silent passage

full moon -
the first sign of life
on the tarmac

the crescent moon -
the softness of her words
on my lips

evening    news -
the softness
of her words

day  full of stars -
the warmth
of the candle

day  full of shadows -
the warmth
of her hand

the scent of his wife -
thunder tapping
on the window

a haiku to another day -
the silence
of the clouds

the crescent moon -
the warmth
of his lips

morning   full of new life -
the warmth
of her hands

the first raindrops -
my breath in the river

no wind tonight -
an empty bed
at the back of the road

a cuddle   at home -
the warmth
of his skin

the crescent moon -
the warmth
of his lips

more cuddly days
at the top of her lungs

more cuddly days
at the top of her lungs

more cuddly days
at the bottom of her lungs

more cuddly days
at the bottom of her lungs

more cuddly days
at the top of her lungs

more cuddly days
at the bottom of her lungs

more cuddly days -
the warmth
of his lips

more cuddly days -
the warmth
of his lips

the smell of water -
at the bottom of the sink

the slow, steady rise
of his tea leaves -
tasting

the slow, steady rise
of his tea leaves -
tasting

the slow, steady rise
of his tea leaves -
tasting

the steady, steady rise
of his tea leaves -
tasting

the steady, steady rise
of his teacup -
tasting well

the steady, steady rise
of his tea leaves -
tasting carefully

the steady, steady rise
of his tea leaves -
tasting carefully

the steady, steady rise
of his cup -
tasting carefully

the steady, steady rise
of a butterfly
seeking our attention

rain
drops onto the grass
lose their color

rain
drops onto the moon -
no more of them

rain
drops on the windshield -
no more of them

rain
drops on the moon -
the next door girl

rain
drops on the window -
her reflection in the window

rain
drops on the window -
a star in the sky
seeking our eyes

rain
drops on the window -
no more of the dishes
at the table

rain
drops on the window-
no more of the dishes
at the table

rain

Easter morning
I ask the baker
for a dozen kinds of bread

a flattened old coffin
does not look like it
needed to be

a quiet evening
the smell of alive
straw hatters

cold rain
a blue haiku
in the graveyard

the dog's barking
stunted by the rain

summer afternoon
the same old mistakes
and the same old smile

moonless night
the blustery scent
of a firefly

July Fourth
I touch down
on the old pier

a blackbird
over the wall
of a coffee shop

November night
the warmth
of a cock and a dozen other
birds

early morning
the orchard
where the dead apple
stays

late night
the cold wave
of a cold snap

spring cleaning
the church doors
of the first year

how many cars
have been sold
yet the name of the parking lot

broken promises
in the old church
the old calendar

still warm
the old stone wall
on which the cat has roamed

November night
the smell of burnt couches
in the kitchen

hot summer
fresh mint and red wine
in the cabinet

where are the two criminals
in the old church?
in the old church

old church
the names of the criminals
gone

August

On the beach of Solenti Beach, Japan, a young man watches a race.
The tide turns green.
It begins to warm itself.

Thanksgiving
the moon ends

It starts raining again.
New year
mixed bag for this one.
Dressing as Spring

dense fog
the taste of fresh oranges

the sound of rain
on the beach

One hundred years
the threshold
of the temple

a white puddle
on the other side of the wall
fog and cold

stuck to the wall
a white puddle
on the other side of the wall

Hiroshima Day
a small white bubble bursts

Orange lily
scent of fresh fruit
over the glass 

Bamboo –
the slow motion of the
distant thunder

flooded train
a flock of mosquitoes
between two buildings

the sound of the clouds
after the rain
on the roof of the building

Christmas lights
the snow melts
into the blue sky

graffiti
the traffic jam
continues on

The cat
has the same history
as the dog

A long time
before the cat was
left to its own devices

he had spent his whole life
before the cat
going to bed

white beach
the sound of the waves
before the storm

to each
The brand new camo blouse
from the old house

the first day of Winter
came with a different shade
than the last

Valentine's day
the smell
of garlic

vacation home
his wife keeps
her old photos

first snow
she wears a red sweater
on the street

winter solstice
looking at her
from the bar

winter dawn
a group of kids
go to the beach

winter moon
she asks the waitress
for her car keys

Celebrating the Silence
the smell
of garlic

morning heat
she goes to the bathroom
to shower

the Great Spirit
he calls her name
in a hurry

morning heat
she looks at the clock
on her computer

morning heat
she looks at her calendar
on her laptop

morning heat
she closes her notebook
on her computer

ripe day
a couple spills coffee
on the sidewalk

morning chill
a woman asks her female neighbor
for his credit card number

cold snap
a man tells her he's sick
of her cooking

morning chill
she and her kids
go to the beach

cold snap
a woman tells her neighbor
she's pregnant

cold snap
a woman tells her neighbor
she's not going to work

cold snap
she tells her neighbor
her clothing is too

In the summer of last year, I saw the stars
in the sky.

I dreamt of the sun
in the sky

from an old house in the valley,
a moth's
flight

the wind blows
the river walls
against the roof of a house

the day
I put my hands together
in the silence

first snow
a deflated beer bottle
in the gift shop

sunglasses -
a great white butterfly
in the afternoon.

after a long day of cooking
I open my laptop
and look at the sunset

the words
of a jasmine
I climb the harvest moon

first date
the silence
of the first

the moon
lightning on the old fire
in the cloud

frost on the old stone
the shadows of the crocuses

in the cave
the warmth of my fingers
against the cold

cloudburst
the full moon
of a few thousand suns

pigeons under the branches
of the old pine tree
on the phone

a cold
for now
I turn off the lights
of my neighbor's house

open window
a cricket's flight
in the dark

frost on the old stone
of the old pine tree
on the phone

a cold
for now
I turn off the lights
of my neighbor's house
