If you are any one who is beautiful,
someone I feel dear.
You are my sunshine.
You are my shining star.
Everything I'm not,
You are.

No words could ever tell you,
No action could express
The way I feel about you.
With you, my life is blessed.

Amazing and beautiful,
not a flower or a tree.
Much prettier than that,
and only I can see.

It's okay to miss you,
It's okay to cry.
Just know I'll never forget you.
This isn't a permanent goodbye.

Once when I was little,
I was happy and carefree.
I used to run around laughing
Until it was time for tea.

When I see you in the morning,
it brightens up my day.
There are so many thoughts on my mind,
so many words I want to say.

She got up this morning,
sun shining through the blind.
She took a look in the mirror,
and something crossed her mind.

I tried so hard.
I tried my best.
I gave you my all,
And now there's nothing left.

You brought me sunshine
when I only saw rain.
You brought me laughter
when I only felt pain.

How could I be so stupid
To let you slip away?
I had you in my arms,
But I let you slip away.

I went down to the river,
I set down on the bank.
I tried to think but couldn't,
So I jumped in and sank.

It's that look in your eye.
It's the smile on your face
That makes time slip by,
And I know I'm in a better place.

"Hope" is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -
And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -

She had looked for his coming as warriors come,
With the clash of arms and the bugle's call;
But he came instead with a stealthy tread,
Which she did not hear at all.

Close your eyes and picture beauty.
What is it that you see?
A baby, a mountain, a river?
Or maybe an old oak tree?

I was the young age of three,
and oh, so very small.
I knew almost nothing,
nothing at all.

To a dad who is terrific,
To a dad who's real neat,
To a dad who makes the best of things,
Even when they're not so sweet!

We all have a massive mountain to climb,
Especially those who've lost someone dear.
But climb that big mountain, we surely must,
If we are going to overcome fear.

The fisherman goes out at dawn
When every one's abed,
And from the bottom of the sea
Draws up his daily bread.

The kings they came from out the south,
All dressed in ermine fine;
They bore Him gold and chrysoprase,
And gifts of precious wine.

Before the ice is in the pools—
Before the skaters go,
Or any check at nightfall
Is tarnished by the snow—

I received a gift from a stranger,
A stranger I did not know.
I had heard his name before,
But just in passing, so I let it go.

Sitting sadly on my bed
Listening to the wild winds blow,
Crying bitterly behind my hair,
Trying not to let it show.

A sign of beauty,
A symbol of grace.
Its pride runs strong
At a very fast pace.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has wither'd from the lake,
And no birds sing.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms!
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel's granary is full,
And the harvest's done.

I see a lily on thy brow
With anguish moist and fever-dew.
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads,
Full beautiful – a faery's child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.

I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She look'd at me as she did love,
And made sweet

You are.

No words could ever tell you,
No action could express
The way I feel about you.
With you, my life is blessed.

Amazing and beautiful,
not a flower or a tree.
Much prettier than that,
and only I can see.

It's okay to miss you,
It's okay to cry.
