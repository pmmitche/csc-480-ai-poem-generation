Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
And things are not what they seem.

Thoughts of you surround me.
You're the beating of my heart.
The love you give defines me.
My life is no longer dark.

I come from haunts of coot and hern,
I make a sudden sally
And sparkle out among the fern,
To bicker down a valley.

The one who brought me down to earth
And held me every day.
The one who gracefully gave me birth
And said, I love you in every way.

Sometimes I dream that I can fly.
I lift and flap my arms just so,
And soon I'm soaring to the sky.
Graceful like a bird I go.

I never really knew you.
You were just another friend,
But when I got to know you,
I let my heart unbend.

It's that look in your eye.
It's the smile on your face
That makes time slip by,
And I know I'm in a better place.

I promise to love you
When your jokes are not funny.
I promise to love you
When you have no money.

I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.

How good to lie a little while
And look up through the tree
The Sky is like a kind big smile
Bent sweetly over me.

We will be what we could be. Do not say,
It might have been, had not or that, or this.
No fate can keep us from the chosen way;
He only might who is.

The time soon comes for parting,
And our time is at an end.
The rest of your life is starting,
And we have no time at all to spend.

He is a friend to remember,
A friend I miss so much.
I think about all the laughter
And even the times we'd touch.

Baby, you tell me you love me.
You tell me you care.
You say you need to have me,
But all I can do is stare.

I felt so rejected, alone and sad,
like an abandoned puppy left to wander a street.
It was then that I realized that my life was really bad,
so I disowned every challenge I happened to meet.

Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck
And yet methinks I have astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality

There was an Old Man with a beard
Two Owls and a Hen
Who said, 'It is just as I feared
Four Larks and a Wren

The sky is very sunny.
Under the tree we sit,
The children are funny.
But just for a bit

The people along the sand
All turn and look one way.
They turn their back on the land.
They look at the sea all day.

Painting on Vellum: not on silk or hide
Or ordinary Canvas: I suppose
No painter of the present day has tried
So many mediums with success, or knows

Prince! do not let your Nose, your royal Nose,
Your large imperial Nose get out of Joint.
For though you cannot touch my golden Prose,
Painting on Vellum is my weakest point.

Others abide our question. Thou art free.
Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill,
Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,
We ask and askâ€”Thou smilest and art still,
