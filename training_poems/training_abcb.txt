here in your arms
is where i belong
the beating of your heart
is like a beautiful song

i like cats
no you are not mine
who are you
i feel like im nine

I don't know when it happened.
I don't know when she came,
But she's the one I always knew.
Grandma was her name.

Nobody knows it's empty,
The smile that I wear.
The real one is left behind in the past
Because I left you there...

From the day that I first knew you,
Your heart was pure and kind;
Your smile was sweet and innocent,
Your wit was well refined.

I don't think you will
Ever fully understand
How you've touched my life
And made me who I am.

In your arms,
I'm in my safe haven.
With you holding me tight,
I have no other craving.

Hold fast to dreams
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird
That cannot fly.

You are my sunshine.
You are my shining star.
Everything I'm not,
You are.

No words could ever tell you,
No action could express
The way I feel about you.
With you, my life is blessed.

Amazing and beautiful,
not a flower or a tree.
Much prettier than that,
and only I can see.

It's okay to miss you,
It's okay to cry.
Just know I'll never forget you.
This isn't a permanent goodbye.

Once when I was little,
I was happy and carefree.
I used to run around laughing
Until it was time for tea.

When I see you in the morning,
it brightens up my day.
There are so many thoughts on my mind,
so many words I want to say.

She got up this morning,
sun shining through the blind.
She took a look in the mirror,
and something crossed her mind.

I tried so hard.
I tried my best.
I gave you my all,
And now there's nothing left.

You brought me sunshine
when I only saw rain.
You brought me laughter
when I only felt pain.

How could I be so stupid
To let you slip away?
I had you in my arms,
But I let you slip away.

I went down to the river,
I set down on the bank.
I tried to think but couldn't,
So I jumped in and sank.

It's that look in your eye.
It's the smile on your face
That makes time slip by,
And I know I'm in a better place.

"Hope" is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -
And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -

She had looked for his coming as warriors come,
With the clash of arms and the bugle's call;
But he came instead with a stealthy tread,
Which she did not hear at all.

Close your eyes and picture beauty.
What is it that you see?
A baby, a mountain, a river?
Or maybe an old oak tree?

I was the young age of three,
and oh, so very small.
I knew almost nothing,
nothing at all.

To a dad who is terrific,
To a dad who's real neat,
To a dad who makes the best of things,
Even when they're not so sweet!

We all have a massive mountain to climb,
Especially those who've lost someone dear.
But climb that big mountain, we surely must,
If we are going to overcome fear.

The fisherman goes out at dawn
When every one's abed,
And from the bottom of the sea
Draws up his daily bread.

The kings they came from out the south,
All dressed in ermine fine;
They bore Him gold and chrysoprase,
And gifts of precious wine.

Before the ice is in the pools—
Before the skaters go,
Or any check at nightfall
Is tarnished by the snow—

I received a gift from a stranger,
A stranger I did not know.
I had heard his name before,
But just in passing, so I let it go.

Sitting sadly on my bed
Listening to the wild winds blow,
Crying bitterly behind my hair,
Trying not to let it show.

A sign of beauty,
A symbol of grace.
Its pride runs strong
At a very fast pace.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has wither'd from the lake,
And no birds sing.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms!
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel's granary is full,
And the harvest's done.

I see a lily on thy brow
With anguish moist and fever-dew.
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads,
Full beautiful – a faery's child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.

I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She look'd at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan.

I set her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long;
For sidelong would she bend, and sing
A faery's song.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild and manna-dew;
And sure in language strange she said,
I love thee true.

She took me to her elfin grot,
And there she wept and sigh'd full sore;
And there I shut her wild, wild eyes
With kisses four.

And there she lullèd me asleep,
And there I dream'd – ah! woe betide!
The latest dream I ever dream'd
On the cold hill's side.

I saw pale kings and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all:
They cried, La belle Dame sans Merci
Hath thee in thrall!

I saw their starved lips in the gloam
With horrid warning gapèd wide,
And I awoke and found me here
On the cold hill's side.

And this is why I sojourn here
Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is wither'd from the lake,
And no birds sing.
